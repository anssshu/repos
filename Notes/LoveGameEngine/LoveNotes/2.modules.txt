love

When beginning to write games using LÖVE, the most important parts of the API are the callbacks: love.load to do one-time setup of your game, love.update which is used to manage your game's state frame-to-frame, and love.draw which is used to render the game state onto the screen.

More interactive games will override additional callbacks in order to handle input from the user, and other aspects of a full-featured game.

LÖVE provides default placeholders for these callbacks, which you can override inside your own code by creating your own function with the same name as the callback:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Load some default values for our rectangle.
function love.load()
    x, y, w, h = 20, 20, 60, 20;
end

-- Increase the size of the rectangle every frame.
function love.update(dt)
    w = w + 1;
    h = h + 1;
end

-- Draw a coloured rectangle.
function love.draw()
    love.graphics.setColor(0, 100, 100);
    love.graphics.rectangle('fill', x, y, w, h);
end
