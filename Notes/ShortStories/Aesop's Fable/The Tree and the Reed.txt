The Tree and the Reed 

that was 
to a Reed 
said a Tree 
little one,’ 
‘Well, 
growing at 
feet 
‘why do you not plant your 
foot, 
its 
deeply in the ground, and raise your head boldly in the air 
as I do?’ 
‘I am contented with my lot,’ said the Reed. ‘I may not 
be so grand, but I think I am safer.’ 
‘Safe!’ sneered the Tree. ‘Who shall pluck me up by the 
roots or bow my head to the ground?’ But it soon had to 
repent of its boasting, for a hurricane arose which tore it 
up from its roots, and cast it a useless log on the ground, 
while the little Reed, bending to the force of the wind, 
soon stood upright again when the storm had passed over. 
Obscurity often brings safety.
