libGdx is a java game library
a complete feature reach and multi platform games can  be creates with it
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
this  note is prepared so that it would be helpful   coding the game
and can be reffered when ever needed.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
the basic constituents of a 2d game is

* camera ---for moving inside the screen screens
* colorful or gradient background
* sprites (these are objects created from textures[images])
* sprite sheets
* tileMaps--for creating the level background
* inputs-----keyboard,joystics,mouse,onscreen keypads
* audio-sound such as background music
* animations---------------------
* text----for writing scores or data on the screen
* particles--for effects like fire,rain,spark,smoke, steam
* menus and setting screen------for starting screen changing game keys etc
* splash screens and loading screens
* UI elements like buttons progress bars etc
* levels and scene changing logic
* AI for the game characters ----this is simple scripts
* collision detection logic and function
* physics and constraints or much more simulated world
* object higher archie and connection(stage ,actor and actions with sequences ,parallels and repeats)
* inter object communications for better game logic
